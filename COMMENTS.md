- I added NX because angular 16 with jest and Testing Library fails for some reasons, which does not with NX
- I changed data.service.ts to todos.store.ts to make it more explicit
- I added tailwindcss to make the stylying easier
- I went for ESBuild & Component Store using selectSignal() ðŸš€
- I'm using component first architecture (see: https://colum-ferry.medium.com/component-first-architecture-with-angular-and-standalone-components-f9fc6a6cbd11)
